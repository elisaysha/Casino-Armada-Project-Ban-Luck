## 🎯 Why This Game?

I really enjoyed playing this card game during Chinese New Year. However, during the non-CNY periods I've always yearned to play it again! I tried searching for online games but they don't shuffle and distribute the cards fairly online. It was all rigged! Moreover, Ban Luck is only found in countries like Malaysia and Singapore only, and Ban Luck is not the same as Blackjack.

## 👥 Who It’s For

- Targetted for ALL players young and old! (But must be able to count! hehe)
- Individuals who love Math
- If you would like to see how the code behind this works :0

## 🕹️ How to Play

- You start with **$1000**.
- Before each round, you **place a bet**.
- You are dealt two cards, and so is the dealer (hidden).
- Choose to **(h)it** (draw a card) or **(s)tand** (keep your hand).
- Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- If your total is higher than the dealer's (or the dealer busts), you win.
- A **Ban Luck** (Ace + 10-value card as the first two cards) pays **double** your bet.
- A **Ban Ban** (Ace + Ace) pays **thrice** your bet.
- A **Triple 7** (Three cards only, all are 7!) pays **seven times** your bet.
- A **Wu Long (五龙)** (5 cards, total below 21) pays **double** your bet.
- Take 5 cards and bust, you lose double too!
- If you run out of money, the game ends.

## 🚧 Things to Improve

- some of the win messages are abit all over the place due to some coding errors
- game structure abit laggy due to some scenes being cut off (does not affect gameplay)
- some features still do not work (e.g. probability counting). might come back after olevels to revive it!!

---

## ✅ What Went Well

- It works!
- One of the few fair ban luck online games :)
- The testers like it hehe

---

## 💬 What Could Be Better

- Abit messy...
- Alot of code could have been in UDFs instead to shorten in
- Some code is actually skipped, but i still left it there

To my friends who help me test the game, and to the developers of online Blackjack games who motivated me through their unjust games...
